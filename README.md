# MrNewbWeaponTints

Welcome to the readme :)


These are weapon tints/ serial removals for ox_inventory, and I've included an item for removing serial numbers. I've noticed they haven't been offered for free yet, so I'm releasing them to assist others. Please refrain from selling them out of respect. I advocate for collaboration, sharing code, and teamwork. I kindly request not to alter the name since this is my first release in over a year, despite its modest size, it serves a valuable purpose. Additionally, I want to express gratitude to the ox team for making this possible. Feel free to customize consumption according to your preferences.
